            <p>Hello! I am Joyce Villanueva. I am from University of Southeastern Philippines and a third-year student of the department Institute of Computing studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Also, I am a club member of ILCAPELLA which is a choir group handled by the University.</p>
            <p>From my three years of studying, I gained knowledge about some programming languages such as Scratch, DevC++, Java, and SQL,  and learned other tools such as photoshop, illustrator, corel video studio, and cisco packet tracer.</p>
            <p>I am interested in music. I am a pianist in our church. I love to sing, dance, and read. My ambition is to enroll in a music school.</p>
